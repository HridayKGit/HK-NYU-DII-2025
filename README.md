# Project Name: HK-NYU-DII-2025
# Project Description: At the NYU Design, Invent and Innovate Program, my team and I designed and built and electronic pillbox with an audiovisual alarm system. We used an Arduino Uno to control the electronics, and therefore we programmed it. This repository contains our code. Our pillbox had one push button, an LCD screen, two speakers, an RTC, LED strips and a battery to power it. 
# Collaborators: My teammates were named Rachel, Matian and Reshma.
